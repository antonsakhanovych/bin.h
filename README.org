* bin.h
 Priority queue implementation

** Get started
Check out [[./bin.h][bin.h]] for methods available.

#+begin_src c
// use binheap_init() to initialize binary heap
Binary_Heap *binh = binheap_init();

// to free memory use
binheap_deinit(binh);
#+end_src

** Other notes
Since ~binheap_construct(int* arr, size_t size);~ doesn't allocate memory for the array. You should pass malloc'd array.
